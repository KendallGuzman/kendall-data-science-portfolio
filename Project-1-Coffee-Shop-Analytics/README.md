# Coffee Shop Sales Analytics & Customer Insights

##  Business Problem
A coffee shop wants to better understand customer purchasing behavior and sales trends to improve revenue.

##  Project Goal
This project answers:

- What products generate the most revenue?
- What times of day are busiest?
- What does a typical transaction look like?
- Can we identify high-value purchases?

##  Key Steps
1. Data cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Sales and revenue visualizations  
4. High-value transaction detection  
5. Simple predictive modeling (optional)


##  Key Findings (Current Data)

Using the available monthly revenue totals (Jan–Jun), we observed:

- Revenue shows an overall upward trend from January to June.
- February had a small decline compared to January (–$5.5K).
- The largest increase occurred between April and May (+$37.8K).
- May and June represent the strongest sales months in the dataset.

These trends suggest increased customer demand starting in spring.


##  Tools Used
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- NumPy  

##  Next Steps
- Predict high-value transactions  
- Build a dashboard-style summary
